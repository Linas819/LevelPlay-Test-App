## Project features
App uses data in Json file to generate leves where you have to connect dots. Dot are numbered from 1 and have to be pressed one by one. Dots cannot be pressed by going over (after 3rd dot the 4th one must be pressed and not any other). Line is drawn continuously. If the next dot is clicked before line is done drawing, it automaticly fills up and the next line will begin drawing.
